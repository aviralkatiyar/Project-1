      <h2>Problem We Are Facing</h2>
      <p>• A report reveals that Indian government imports 45 million tonnes of garbage every year from different countries. Not only this, but this number also increases by 4 per cent every year. On the other hand INDIA produces 65 millions tonnes of waste every year. This waste that accumulates in such a huge quantity is of many types. One is recyclable i.e. plastic and non-biodegradable waste and finally comes bio-medical such as sanitary and hazardous waste. All these waste is being dumped on free land if these continues than in coming years every city will several number of these "WASTE MOUNTAIN".

        <br>• These waste mountains affects us long term. One can develop diseases such as asthma, birth defects, cancer, cardiovascular disease, childhood cancer, COPD, infectious diseases, low birth weight, and preterm delivery.
        
        <br>• Burying garbage also causes both air and water pollution, and simply transporting it to the sites consumes an increasing amount of valuable fossil fuels, which produces more pollution and other problems.</p>

        <h1>Solution </h1>
        <p>We are revolutionising the mass by changing the behaviour and mindset towards waste .It will be done by making them aware that they can monetise their waste.

          These step will lead them to treat waste properly.</p><br>
          <p>We will ask the people to segregate the waste at the source in at least 3 categories and in return we will provide them with rewards like gift vouchers and coupons.
          </p><br>
          <p>We will create a family ranking system based on their contribution towards segregation. Top families will be rewarded and appreciated by the government .</p>
