    <h1><center>Types of Waste</center></h1>
    <h3><u><center>1) Organic Waste</center></u></h3>
    <center><img src="1.jpg" alt="organic waste image"></center>
    <p  style="font-size:30px">Organic waste materials are obtained from living organisms such as plants or animals. 
        They are usually found in municipal, agricultural, industrial, and wastewaters. Some 
        organic waste matters are suitable for composting while others are suitable for producing
         Biogas through the process of recycling. About 44% of organic waste is composed of food 
         wastage. Food waste management in India and other developing countries is a major dilemma.
          Food waste when diverted to landfill generate unpleasant odor, attract pests moreover, it
         releases methane into the air.</p>
         <h3><u><center>2) Inorganic Waste</center></u></h3>
         <center><img src="2.jpg" alt="Inorganic waste image"></center>
         <p  style="font-size:30px">Inorganic waste is a type of waste that does not contain organic compounds. This waste 
            is generally very difficult to decompose by microorganisms. Glass, aluminum cans, dust,
             and metal are some examples of inorganic waste. Inorganic waste remains free from decay,
              with more than 500 years needed being common for effective decomposition,therefore disposal
               can be challenging. Reducing consumption, reusing, and recycling are possible solutions for
                coping with this type of waste.</p>
               <h3><u><center>E-Waste</center></u></h3>
               <center><img src="3.jpg" alt="E-Waste image"></center>
               <p  style="font-size:30px">E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment thatâ€™s been discarded. This includes
                 working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or donated to a charity reseller 
                 like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be thrown away. E-waste
                  is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside
                   when buried.</p>
